  Dear Erin,    
  
  I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to request an inspection of our MRI machine. We have been experiencing some issues with it and we need to diagnose the problem and get it fixed as soon as possible.    
  
  The MRI machine is a GE Signa HDxt 1.5T. It was installed in 2012 and has been in operation since then. It has been regularly maintained and serviced, but we have noticed a decline in its performance in the last few weeks. We have noticed that the images produced by the machine are not as clear as they used to be and it takes longer than usual to produce the images. We suspect that there may be an issue with the coil or the gradient system.    
  
  I apologize for not providing more details earlier. I assumed that you would already have access to our service history and performance data. Please let me know if there is any other information you need from us.    
  
  Thank you for your help.    
  
  Best regards,    
  Bob
